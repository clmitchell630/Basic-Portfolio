            <p>
                Currently, I am the Assistant Store Manager at the Seward Co-op Friendship Store. There I work to ensure
                staff and customer
                safety, maintenance of the physical store structure, and support of sales departments. As for personel,
                I
                manage the facilities
                department's two roles, Manager on Duty and Housekeeper. I am responsible for directing the goals for
                the
                department, ensure
                proper training, develop new practices, ensure efficient work flow, and hold staff accountable to the
                department's and
                organization's policies and expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
                While my experience as the Assistant Store Manager has provided me with a tremendous amount of important
                lessons and growth, I
                have decided to begin my first steps toward a career that is within my interests. Coding Bootcamp is a
                program that I am currently
                participating in to help teach me fundamental full stack web development. I believe that this program
                will
                give me the tools to
                help push me into a field that I find both exciting and rewarding.
