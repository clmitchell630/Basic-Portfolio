            Currently, I am the Assistant Store Manager at the Seward Co-op Friendship Store. There I work to ensure
            staff and customer
            safety, maintenance of the physical store structure, and support of sales departments. As for personel, I
            manage the facilities
            department's two roles, Manager on Duty and Housekeeper. I am responsible for directing the goals for the
            department, ensure
            proper training, develop new practices, ensure efficient work flow, and hold staff accountable to the
            department's and
            organization's policies and expectations.
        </p>

            While my experience as the Assistant Store Manager has provided me with a tremendous amount of important
            lessons and growth, I
            have decided to begin my first steps toward a career that is within my interests. Coding Bootcamp is a
            program that I am currently
            participating in to help teach me fundamental full stack web development. I believe that this program will
            give me the tools to
            help push me into a field that I find both exciting and rewarding.
